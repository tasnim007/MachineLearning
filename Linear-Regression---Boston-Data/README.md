# Diagnosis of cancer using Decision Tree Learning

## Problem Description:
The dataset is from UCI Machine Learning Dataset and can be found [Here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). We used Boston House Prices dataset in this project.

**First**, we compltete univariate regression model. For this, we used number of rooms features from the dataset as our input variable.

**Later**, we completed multivariate regression model. For this, we used all the features of the dataset as our input variable. We also performed cross validation on this model.
