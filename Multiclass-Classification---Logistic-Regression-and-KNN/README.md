# MultiClass Classification

## Problem Description:
The dataset is from UCI Machine Learning Dataset and can be found [Here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris). We used famous IRIS dataset in this project.

**First**, we visualized the data using different plots of the dataset. Then we used logistic regression to classify the data.

**Later**, we KNearest Neighbor for the classification. We observed accuracy for a range of K's values

For both case we used cross validation techniques.
