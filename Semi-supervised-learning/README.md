# Semi-supervised learning

## Problem Description:

**Goal:** Using both labeled and unlabeled data to build better learners

**Steps:**

**Tasks:**
1.  Use ID3 decision tree learner with information gain for evaluation criterion
2.  Divide the dataset as
  + Training data (80%)
    + Labeled data (50%)
    + Unlabeled data (50%)
  + Test data (20%)
3.  At each step give label to 10% of the total unlabeled data 


**Comparison with Supervised learning:**

Run the experiment 10 times and take average values

Compare this learning method with the supervised decision tree learning method (1st Assignment) in terms of 
+ Accuracy
+ Precision
+ Recall
+ F-measure


## Implementation:
**Language:** C++
G-mean
