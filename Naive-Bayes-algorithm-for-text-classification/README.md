# Na√Øve Bayes algorithm for text classification

## Problem Description:

The goal of text classification is to identify the topic for a piece of text (news article, web-blog, etc.). Text classification has obvious utility in the age of information overload, and it has become a popular turf for applying machine learning algorithms. In this project, you will have the opportunity to implement Naive Bayes Algorithm and apply it to text classification on the well known Reuter news collection.

1.  Get the dataset , which is created from the original collection and contains a training file, a test file, the topics, and the format for train/test.

2.  Implement the Naive Bayes Algorithm. What's the accuracy of your learner? (Try various smoothing parameters for the Naive Bayes learner. Which parameters work best?)


## Implementation:
**Language:** C++
